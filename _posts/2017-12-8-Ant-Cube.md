title: Recursive Expectations Part  - A Random Ant On A Cube
---

## Problem

There is an ant sitting on the lower left vertex of a cube (vertex A), at each step the ant randomly moves to an adjecent vertex with equal probability. What is the expected number of steps it would take ant to reach the upper right vertex of this cube (vertex B)?
