title: Recursive Expectations Part 2 - A Random Ant On A Cube
---

## Problem

There is an ant sitting on the lower left vertex of a cube (vertex A), at each step the ant randomly moves to an adjecent vertex with equal probability. What is the expected number of steps it would take ant to reach the upper right vertex of this cube (vertex B)?

## Solution

The expected distance in terms of steps from A to B depends on the expected distance between the adjecent vertexes of A and B. The adjacent vertexes of A are all labelled as \(I_1\) because, by symmetry, the expected distances from them to B are identical. In turn, the expected distance from \(I_1\) to B depends on the expected distance from the adjacent vertexes of \(I_1\) to B. In this case, \(I_1\) has two kinds of adjacent vertexes: A and those labelled as \(I_2\). Continuing this argument on \(I_2\), we would reach a recursive (and circular) relations among the distnaces from A, from \(I_1\) and from \(I_2\) to B.

Before we wirte down the equtions, we introduce some notations:

$$ \begin{align}
R_0 : A \rightarrow B \\
R_1 : I_1 \rightarrow B \\
R_2 : I_2 \rightarrow B
\end{align} $$
