title: How to Get a Quant Job
---

In this post, I share resources and practical tips about how to get a quant job.

## Preparation

Be prepared. Generally, a quant recruiter is looking for a candidate who knows:

- Math
- Stats (Machine Learning)
- Programming
- Finance

An example of a quant job description is [this](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/careers/programs/qr-fulltime-associate).

It is hard to be an expert in all four areas. Ideally, a candidate is strong in one area, while knowing a little bit about other areas.

For those [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) majors, it is worthwhile spending some time learning about finance. A good choice is to study the [CFA Program](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx). If you can pass at least its [Level I Exam](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/exams/Pages/level_I_exam_prep.aspx), you should already have a basic yet comprehensive knowledge of finance.

Some exposure to [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) would make a more favorable candidate. If you want to get your foot into the door, consider taking a [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) course like [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). To get some hands-on experience of machine learning, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an excellent [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) competition platform.

## Application

Most firms in the quant space accept online applications, a great place to start is this [quant firm list](https://www.quantnet.com/threads/quant-internship-and-graduate-recruitment-a-firms-list.10000/).

Apply early. Big investment banks typically have their own recruiting cycles, so don't miss their deadlines.

### Resume

Learn from others. [Princeton MFin students' resume book](http://bcf.princeton.edu/master-in-finance/mfin-directory/) have many good examples.

### Cover Letter

Not many firms ask for a cover letter. My cover letter simply expand my resume, and elaborate on my past experience on math, stats (machine learning), programming and finance.

## Interview

Interview questions can be quite comprehensive, covering math, stats (machine learning), programming and finance.

Classic quant interview books include:
- [Heard on the Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0994103867)
- [A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662)

Before an interview, I would also check:

- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)
- Interviewer's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile

In this blog, I will constantly post some most commonly asked interview questions.

It usually take several rounds of phone interviews and one on-site interview to get an offer.

The more interviews your get, the stronger your become as a candidate. Persistence is key. Good luck!
